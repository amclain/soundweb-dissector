## Developer Documentation

The following section is for people who wish to modify or contribute to this
dissector. This section is not relevant to a standard installation.


### Ruby

Ruby 2.1 or higher is required to run the scripts that generate the packet
captures in the `sample_data` directory. Ruby can be obtained via the
[RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) for Windows, or
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for Linux. If installing on
Windows, make sure Ruby is in your [system path](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).

Once Ruby is installed, open the [command prompt](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window)
and execute the following commands:

    gem update
    gem install ionian

In `sample_data/scripts/soundweb.rb`, set the `SOUNDWEB_IP` constant to the IP
address of your Soundweb hardware. The `.rb` scripts in `sample_data/scripts`
can now be executed, and the packets generated by the scripts can be captured
with Wireshark.
